	<h1>web-examples</h1>
	<p>Here you will find a collection of examples that I have written to help a friend learn about SQL. These days it to easy to grab a framework and not know whats going on inside. I have tried to keep these as raw as posible because it allows people to understand the basics. I feel I must also add that I am not a web developer, more an embedded C programer for Digital TV's. I do however create a lot of web based test scripts for testing our TV's browsers capabilities.</p>
