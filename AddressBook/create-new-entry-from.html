	<p>This page uses the HTML form element to group input boxes. It then will POST the contents of the boxes to another page, in our case another PHP script that will insert the data into the database and redirect us back to the home page. This is a very basic input page and will not handle errors or missing fields. Its main purpose it to demonstrate the proccess of collecting data and forwarding it onto another script to insert it into our database table.</p>
	
	<!-- create the form element -->
	<form method="POST" action="insert-entry.php">
		<!-- draw the data input form (we will use a table to keep it all aligned) -->
		<table>
			<tr>
				<th>Name:</th>
				<td><input type="text" name="name" maxlength="50"></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<th>Phone Number:</th>
				<td><input type="text" name="phone_number" maxlength="15"></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<th>email:</th>
				<td><input type="text" name="email" maxlength="100"></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<th>Address:</th>
				<td><textarea name="address"></textarea></td>
